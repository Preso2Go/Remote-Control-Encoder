# Remote-Control-Encoder
Javascript and C# code examples to remote control a Presentations 2Go encoder lecture capture recorder.

This project shares sample code to control Presentations 2Go Encoder(s) via a webinterface or custom application. This way you can simplify the interface for teachers to a minimum amount of buttons. 
The code examples are based on the Presentations 2Go Remote Control API as described in http://upgrade.presentations2go.eu/p2g.api/Encoder.RemoteControl/APIv3.5/
